# CMake version of glad loader
Using OpenGL 4.6 and all `EXT` and `ARB` extensions. You can change the output directory by setting `GLAD_CUSTOM_OUTPUT` and then setting `GLAD_CUSTOM_OUTPUT_DEBUG`, `GLAD_CUSTOM_OUTPUT_RELEASE` and so on to the specific paths.
#### Licence Notice: Only CMake files are made by me. Source and Header files were generated using Dav1dde's OpenGL loader generator.
